# Features

These are the key features of the project:

- Web scraper to supplement open-source dataset (`/web-scraper`)
- Data Analysis techniques and Visualization tools (`/data_visualization/data-visualization.py`)
- Machine Learning (`/machine_learning/machinelearning.py`)
- Predictive Analysis with Hyperparameters Tuning (`/machine_learning/machinelearning.py` and `/machine_learning/tuning_hyperparam.py`)
- Graphical User Interface (`client/src/App.vue`)


# Contents

The contents within this zip file and repository are as follows:

* `amenities` folder - contains `getAmenities.py` file that accesses the respective column in `/csv_files/amenities.csv`. Given a postal code input, the function selects the corresponding row with that postal code and retrieves the value from the specified column.
* `client` folder - contains the source codes used to build our Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* `csv_files` folder - contains all the processed csv files used for this project.
* `data_visualization` folder - contains `data-visualization.py` file that has all the codes of basic charts we used to explore to gain deeper understanding of the data used.
* `machine_learning` folder - contains everything pertaining to our usage machine learning and hyperparameters tuning.
* `node_modules` folder - contains all CSS and Bootstrap files to style our GUI.
* `opensource_dataset` folder - contains all the raw open-sourced csv files we took from data.gov.sg, as well `dataset.py` that we used to preprocess the raw data.
* `templates` folder contains `heatmap_map.html` which is the folium heatmap generated to provide an effective visualization of the distribution, density and resale price of HDB across Singapore.
* `web_scraper` folder contains everything related to our web scrapped dataset used to complement the open-sourced dataset from data.gov.sg
* `app.py` is the main Flask application that houses this Project.
